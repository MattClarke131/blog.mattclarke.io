          Starting over from stratch was a good call. I've gotten further along this time, with an appropriate degree of sophistication for a first prototype. We have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A player character that can move around the screen</li>
          <li>A tile-based map that scrolls as the player moves</li>
          <li>multiple players connecting to a server and seeing each other move around the map</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Mon Nov 24</h2>
        <p>
          I've figured out a basic structure for game loop and rendering. I'm going to start again from scratch, knowing what I know now.
        </p>

        <h2>Sat Nov 22, 2025</h2>
        <p>At this early stage of bootstrapping a game, my mind jumps around a lot. I'm trying to strike a balance between big picture planning, and fast, incremental attempts.</p>
        <h3> Pebble </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Created key bindings for movement (wasd & hjkl)</li>
          <li>Displayed player coordinates in gameview</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Fri Nov 21, 2025</h2>
        <p>Started work on a new game project. The focus is on creating a simple, yet engaging experience that can be expanded over time.</p>
        <h3> Initial Setup </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Set up project repository</li>
          <li>Created basic game loop structure</li>
          <li>Implemented simple rendering of player character</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
